# Fefe is You

I have been really enjoying the game [Baba is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/), so I wanted to try recreating its main mechanic.

Please note that this code was slapped together quickly by a Rust amateur - I don't know what I'm doing, so the code probably isn't of the best quality ðŸ™ƒ.
